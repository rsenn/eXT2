What is this PVOC thing?
------------------------

The phase vocoder is a tool for sound analysis and resynthesis. This
package provides an adaptation of the CARL implementation of the
phase vocoder, along with three example LADSPA plugins conceived
by Trevor Wishart and Richard Dobson, and a sound file time-stretching
utility written by Tim Goetze.

Requirements
============

To build the example plugins and the 'stretch' utility, you need to
have the FFTW3 (Fourier Transform library) and libsndfile (sound file
access library) packages installed. This package does not provide a
configure script, so you'll have to check for correct package versions
yourself:

$ pkg-config --modversion fftw3f

should output '3.0.1' or higher, and

$ pkg-config --modversion sndfile

should output '1.0.5' or higher.

The Makefile employs pkg-config to obtain library and header locations
for these packages, so checking for correct versions should suffice.

To obtain these fine libraries, visit http://www.fftw.org/ for FFTW3 and
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ for libsndfile respectively.


Installation
============

At the shell prompt, enter (without the '$' denoting the prompt itself):

$ make

then, as the superuser, enter:

# make install

Please note that the default installation prefix is /usr/local ;
if you prefer another place, you need to edit the Makefile or install
manually.


Bug reports
-----------

Bug reports should be sent to <tim@quitte.de>. Please include a detailed
description of the misbehaviour and instructions on how to reproduce the
bug.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you have trouble compiling this package, please send a bug report 
containing the output of the 'make' command to <tim@quitte.de>.
