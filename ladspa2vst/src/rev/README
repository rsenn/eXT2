Version 0.3.1
--------------------------------------------

Added code to reset all audio upon deactivate(). Parameters
are preserved across deactivate()/activate().

Many thanks to Chris Cannam for pointing out the problem and
for providing patches to solve it.

g2reverb.so  -- First release - 22/8/2003
--------------------------------------------

This reverb is based on gverb by Juhana Sadeharju, but the code
(now C++) is entirely original. I added a second input for stereo
operation, and some code to prevent FP denormalisation.
This is a preliminary release, and this plugin will probably change
a lot in future versions.
