blvco 0.3.0 -- 12/4/2004
--------------------------------------------------

Pulse-VCO : Anti-aliased dirac pulse oscillator (flat amplitude spectrum)
Saw-VCO   : Anti-aliased sawtooth oscillator (1/F amplitude spectrum)
Rec-VCO   : Anti-aliased square / rectange oscillator

All three oscillators are based on the same principle of using a precomputed
interpolated dirac pulse. For the sawtooth and rectangular versions, the 'edge'
is made by integrating the anti-aliased pulse.

Aliases should be below -80dB for fundamental frequencies below Fsamp / 6
(i.e. up to 8 kHz at Fsamp = 48 kHz). This frequency range includes the
fundamental frequencies of all known musical instruments.

Alpha versions of this plugin were evaluated by Matthias Nagorni, who
compared their outputs to the sounds produced by his Moog Voyager and
Doepfer synthesisers. Matthias reported that the plugins sounded quite
'harsh' when compared to his analogue instruments. Comparing the spectra,
it became clear that a mathematically 'exact' spectrum was not desirable
from a musical point of view. For this reason, I added the lowpass filters.
The default setting (0.5) will give you a sawtooth that is identical to the
output of the Moog Voyager.

The rectangulare VCO and and sync inputs are very much experimental at this
stage. Feedback appreciated.
